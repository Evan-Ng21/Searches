# Unit D1 Lesson 8  
Let's create a simple program that lets the user search through an array of names for a name that the user inputs.
## Instructions

* You can use the same array that you've been using for Lessons 5 and 7. Make two versions: scrambledArray and sortedArray.
* Prompt the user to enter a name. Then search the two arrays using the appropriate search methods. 
* If the name is in one of the arrays, output the message "[name] was found in [arrayName] at position [index#]." 
* If the name is not found in an array, output the message "[name] was not found in [arrayName]".
